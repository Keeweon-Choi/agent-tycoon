 * The standalone server's token, persisted across restarts.
 *
 * The token is the ONLY thing that makes a standalone browser session
 * privileged (hooks toggle, launching agents, attaching to their terminals --
 * see httpServer.ts standaloneTokenValid), and it reaches the browser inside
 * the URL the CLI prints. A per-process token would invalidate that URL on
 * every restart, so a bookmark or a home-screen web app pointing at a
 * long-running server (a background service on an always-on machine) would need a
 * fresh copy each time. Persisting it keeps the printed URL stable.
 *
 * Stored on its own, mode 0600, beside server.json -- never in config.json,
 * which is world-readable and rewritten wholesale by every settings change.
 * The file's own mode is the protection: the office folder may have been
 * created earlier with a looser mode, and mkdir never tightens an existing
 * directory. Falls back to a per-process
 * token when the file cannot be written, so a read-only HOME still gets a
 * working (if unstable) server.
 *
 * A persisted token never expires, so `rotate` is the revocation path for a
 * leaked URL: it mints a fresh token and overwrites the file, and every URL
 * carrying the old one -- on every device -- stops granting privilege.
